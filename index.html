		<h1>Hi There! I'm Justin. I study Computer Science at UKZN. Thank you for finding your way to my little parking spot on the internet.  I like programming, mostly due to the fact that coding is the most powerful tool in modern-day society. Apart from programming, I love science and technology in general. To be completely honest, my favourite course ever taken was probably an "Advanced Calculus" course earlier this year. I enjoy challenges because they can push you further than you ever thought you could go and ultimately force you to learn something new. When you find yourself in an industry which praises innovation, you have no option but to create something special. I look forward to being part of a team such as this.</h1>
